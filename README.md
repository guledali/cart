1. Write a small command line program in Ruby for simulating a shopping cart (like a webshop). Create functions for:

  - adding and removing items to/from the cart

  - printing what's in the cart and the total cost

  - applying a discount of getting the cheapest item for free when buying 3 or more items

  - "making the purchase"

  - a "main" function that simulates a shopping experience, by adding some stuff and removing some stuff, while showing what's in the cart at every step, applying the discount when possible, and finishing off by making the purchase

Note:
  - keep it simple

  - the main function should be runnable from a terminal

  - it doesn't need to be interactive, it can just go through a pre-defined example shopping experience

  - no need for a database or any other "real" data storage

  - write a README with instructions on how to run your program, along with a description of your code and how you approached the task
